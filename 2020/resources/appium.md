## Appium

1. Capabilities

    Appium `Capabilities` are key settings that control entire test run.
    This is the place where you tell appium what platform you need to test, are you going to test on real device or emulator, which is app under test and so on.

2. Locate Elements

    In order to inspect the apps you can use Appium Desktop Application.
    Appium user facing APIs are very close to Selenium, but under the hood Android and iOS are quite different and you should have that in mind.
